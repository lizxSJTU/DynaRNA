# DynaRNA: Dynamic RNA Conformation Ensemble Generation with Diffusion Model
DynaRNA, a diffusion-based generative model for RNA conformation ensemble. DynaRNA employs denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) with equivariant graph neural network (EGNN) to directly model RNA 3D coordinates, enabling rapid exploration of RNA conformational space. 
DynaRNA enables end-to-end generation of RNA conformation ensemble reproducing experimental geometries without the need for Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSA)  information.
